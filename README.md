# IslanderHeap
This is a heap module dessigned as a recursive binary heap, that will have the ability to accept any kind of data including dictionaries
all you have to do when using data from a dictionary is to specify what key term you would like to have the heap sorted by
I go over the implamentation of this code on my youtube channel Islander Robotics
